### Quadratic Fomula Simpler version
How do you factor number 35? Yes, 5 and 7. You may factor it in a second. Then what about 143? It's 11 and 13. You may take a bit longer.
3599? You might just give up. But there is a pattern if you look closely. 35 is simillar as 36. And 36 is square of 6s. 5 and 7 came up natually if you plus and mius 1 to 6. Likewise, 143 is close to 144. 144 is square of 12s. Plus and mius 1 to 12 are 11 and 13. 3599 is close to 3600. So? Plus and minus 1 to 60s are 59 and 61. Yep, you got it. If you see the image, it will help a lot to understand what is going on.

What is this something to do with quadratic fomular? Let's see!

I've learned quadratic formula in middle school. And I had to memorize it to solve some math examples. But I really ddidn't understand what it is and why does it look like itself. what's all the a, b, and c?

First, you need to know that quadratic equation has same solvent even if the quadratic coefficient is different.

So why don't we normalize to 1?
